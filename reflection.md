- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I lowkey love it. I love it because I find it to be very straight forward, I don't want to confidently say I love it because coding them isn't super intuitive yet, but I will get there soon!
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked: MY CODE!!!! I'm super excited and happy that it runs, I'm glad I didn't have to ask for an extention this time.
What didn't: giving up... I tried it, it didn't help so I went to tutoring with my frieds Olohi :)
